# Indep Learn 

## Introduction
Hello and welcome !
*Indep Learn* is an e-learning platform where you can choose a training path based on a topic, technology, language, etc
A training path is structured into courses. Each course has modules that contain learning materials.
The learning materials can either be readings, videos, exercices, solutions, or mandatory QCMs.
It is totally possible to start a course independently of any training path if you need only a specific skill or knowledge.
Throughout your progression, either on courses, paths, or both, you can gain XP and badges.

## The philisophy behind Indep Learn
The name *Indep Learn* hasn't been a random choice. In fact, the idea is to **keep control** of your independence through knowledge.
I personally value a lot AI and its advantages when used properly and in an ethical way.
The bad part of it is that people are starting to rely blindly on LLMs, which can lead to a total loss of creativity and technical abilities.
Also, this can lead to future backdraws because we are progressively breaking a chain of value in the name of profit.
Before LLMs, progression in companies used to be quiet straight, logical and ensured durability :

The issue is that companies are seeking to get senior profiles while cutting junior and intermediate positions.
The problem is that this is a very short term vision. If no one is junior or intermediate by the time I am writing this line, then who will replace the seniors in 5 years ?

Hence, Indep Learn is a platform where you can keep yourself updated, learn new skills. Although you use AI on a daily basis, your knowledge and intelligence should never be inhibited.
